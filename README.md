# MATHGA 2798 - Interest Rate & FX Models
(notes for dummies)

This is my personalized notes for taking the joint two-part course IR&FX by Alexey Kupstov and Fabio Mecurio at Courant. No original course material is directly shown. The notes are for personal digest only. It is not comprehensive; very stylized and most likely contain errors. Please contact me directly if needed to be taken down.   

This condensed notes were made with intent on, (although no promise on if any of the following was successfully or consistently realized; I did my best)
1. clarifying financial defs / notations / "story plot" of financial behaviors / making sense of semiotics, which I personally find to be a big source of confusion when studying Math Finance coming from a Math background,
2. leveraging as much rigor as I was personally comfortable to support the goal of having an applied knowledge, 
3. understanding the mathematic motivation that gives rise to certain procedures
4. being aware of perspective specific to the context of this course; certain things, which can otherwise be canonical/conveniently given in other texts, were not taken for granted or assumed to hold   
5. passing the course
